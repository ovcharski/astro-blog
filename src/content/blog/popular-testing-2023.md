## Survey

[The State Of JavaScript](https://2022.stateofjs.com) is an annually survey to identify upcoming trends in the web development ecosystem in order to help developers make technological choices. As such, the survey is focused on anticipating what's coming over the next few years rather than analyzing what's popular now, which is why the features or technologies that are currently most widespread are not always included. The survey is very popular among developers. Alternative is [Top JavaScript (JS) Trends You Should Follow](https://www.codica.com/blog/top-javascript-trends/) by Codica.

It should also be taken as a snapshot of a specific subset of developers, and is not meant to speak for the entire ecosystem.
