## History of HTC

HTC Corporation, or High Tech Computer Corporation, is a Taiwanese consumer electronics company headquartered in Taoyuan City, Taiwan. Founded in 1997, HTC began as an original design manufacturer (ODM) and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that designed and manufactured laptop computers. The company later expanded into the manufacture of smartphones, tablets, and other consumer electronics.

HTC began to make a name for itself in the mobile phone market in 2004 when it started making Windows Mobile PDAs and smartphones under the Qtek brand. In 2006, the company rebranded its entire range of devices as HTC.

In 2008, HTC joined Google's Open Handset Alliance and released the first device powered by Android, the HTC Dream. The HTC Dream was a major success, and HTC quickly became one of the leading Android smartphone manufacturers. The company released a number of popular Android devices in the following years, including the HTC Hero, HTC Sensation, and HTC One.

Despite its early success, HTC faced a number of challenges in the 2010s. The company's share of the smartphone market began to decline as competition from other manufacturers intensified. In 2012, HTC reported its first quarterly loss since going public in 2002.

In response to these challenges, HTC made a number of changes to its business strategy. The company focused on fewer devices and put more emphasis on design and innovation.

It's worth noting that HTC has faced several challenges in the highly competitive smartphone market, and its prominence has diminished compared to its earlier years. The company has diversified its business, with a focus on virtual reality and other emerging technologies.

## HTC Wildfire

The first HTC Wildfire was originally released in May 2010. It was positioned as an entry-level Android smartphone, offering a compact design and a set of basic features at a more affordable price point. It is a down-sized, down-clocked and down-priced version of the HTC Desire, the brands flagman at the time.

The HTC Wildfire received positive reviews for its compact design, affordability, and the inclusion of HTC's Sense UI, which added a layer of customization to the Android experience. However, it was criticized for its relatively low-resolution display and the modest processing power compared to more high-end smartphones.

## HTC One M8

The HTC One is a series of smartphones produced by HTC Corporation. The series was known for its premium build quality, innovative features, and distinctive design. The HTC One series included several flagship smartphones, such as the HTC One M7, HTC One M8, HTC One M9, and others.

The HTC One M7, simply referred to as the HTC One, was the first phone in the HTC One series. It was released in 2013 and was known for its premium design, impressive build quality, and the introduction of HTC's UltraPixel camera technology. It was generally well-received by both critics and consumers. Despite its positive reception, the HTC One M7 faced stiff competition from other flagship smartphones on the market, particularly from the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the iPhone 5 at the time. Additionally, HTC's marketing and distribution efforts were not as robust as some of its competitors, which may have limited its market reach. Nonetheless, the HTC One M7 left a lasting impression in the smartphone industry and helped establish HTC as a manufacturer known for its premium build quality and innovative features. It set the foundation for subsequent HTC One series models and played a significant role in HTC's history as a smartphone maker.

One year later the One M8 was released. As the CNET said in their review of the phone back then - Think of the HTC One M8 as the big-budget sequel to an Oscar-winning indie film. Last year's HTC One won rave reviews and obsessed fans, but not enough customers to keep HTC growing. This year, HTC needs a rip-roaring box-office hit with its flagship phone. And they did it. The M8 was a big hit and today I will remind you what the phone is, because many of you probably have forgotten. And there are probably people who have not seen it at all.
